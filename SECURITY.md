# Security Policy

This repository contains experimental smart contracts, protocols, and architectural research for seedless and social-recovery based Web3 accounts.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is provided **as-is**, without any warranties or guarantees of any kind.

It is:
- Not a production-ready wallet
- Not a financial product

## 🔐 No Custody, No Control

This project **does not**:
- Store user keys
- Control user funds
- Act as an intermediary
- Provide any recovery service

All logic is implemented in open-source smart contracts or client-side software.

If you deploy or use these contracts, **you are your own custodian**.

## 🧪 Experimental Status

The smart contracts and designs in this repository:
- Have not been audited
- May contain bugs
- May be insecure
- May change or break without notice

They should never be used to secure real or valuable assets without professional security review.

## 🐞 Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead, report it privately by emailing:

**security@seedless-web3.org**  
(or replace with your own email)

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact

## 🧾 No Liability

The authors, contributors, and maintainers of this repository are **not liable** for:

## 🧠 Philosophy

This project explores how Web3 self-custody can become:
- More human-friendly
- More recoverable
- More secure

It does **not** claim to have solved custody or security.

It exists to move the ecosystem forward.
