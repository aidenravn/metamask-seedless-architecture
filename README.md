This repository proposes a next-generation architecture for Web3 wallets that preserves the core principles of self-custody while removing the single-point-of-failure of seed phrases.

Instead of forcing users to manage fragile cryptographic secrets, this model uses smart contract accounts, multi-party computation (MPC), device binding, and social recovery to create a wallet that is secure, recoverable, and human-friendly by default.

The goal is not to weaken self-custody, but to make it usable for real people — enabling mass adoption without introducing custodians or trusted intermediaries.
