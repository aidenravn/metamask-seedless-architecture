⚖️ Legal Disclaimer & Security Warnings

⚠️ IMPORTANT: EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE

Seedless Wallet is an experimental (Alpha) project. The codebase—including smart contracts, MPC (Multi-Party Computation) logic, and migration tools—has NOT undergone a professional third-party security audit. By using this software, you explicitly acknowledge and agree to the following terms:

⸻

1. Risk of Total Loss

Seedless Wallet is a research project. Bugs, logic errors, or vulnerabilities in smart contracts, MPC infrastructure, or migration tools may result in the permanent loss of all digital assets stored in the wallet.
DO NOT USE REAL FUNDS. Use only supported Testnets (e.g., Sepolia, Base Goerli).

⸻

2. No Liability

The developers, contributors, and maintainers of Seedless Wallet are not responsible for any financial losses, data breaches, or loss of wallet access.
The software is provided “AS IS”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied.

⸻

3. Non-Custodial Nature

Seedless Wallet is non-custodial. You are solely responsible for your security setup:
	•	Guardian Management: Losing access to both your device shard and all guardians may make your funds unrecoverable.
	•	Shard Security: MPC reduces single-point-of-failure risks, but cloud shards depend on third-party security (e.g., Google, iCloud, AWS).

⸻

4. Technical Limitations
	•	Transaction Simulation: While transactions are simulated to detect risks, 100% accuracy cannot be guaranteed. Sophisticated phishing attacks or protocol exploits may bypass simulation filters.
	•	Migration Helper: Automated migration of staked assets or complex DeFi positions is experimental. Always verify the output of a migration dry-run before execution.

⸻

5. Open Source & Contributions

Seedless Wallet is licensed under the MIT License. Contributions are welcome, but maintainers do not assume responsibility for third-party code integrated into the project.

⸻

By proceeding, you confirm that you are a technically sophisticated user who understands the inherent risks of blockchain technology, experimental smart contracts, and advanced cryptographic infrastructure.
