⚠️ Seedless Wallet – Experimental Software Warning

Important: Seedless Wallet is an experimental (Alpha) project. Use at your own risk.

By using this software, you acknowledge that you understand the risks and accept full responsibility.

⸻

1️⃣ Total Loss Risk
	•	Bugs, logic errors, or vulnerabilities in smart contracts, MPC, or migration tools may result in permanent loss of all assets.
	•	DO NOT USE REAL FUNDS. Only use Testnets (e.g., Sepolia, Base Goerli).

⸻

2️⃣ No Liability
	•	Developers, contributors, and maintainers are not responsible for any losses or damage.
	•	Software is provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind.

⸻

3️⃣ Non-Custodial Responsibility
	•	You are fully responsible for your wallet security:
	•	Guardian Management: Losing both your device shard and all guardians may make funds unrecoverable.
	•	Shard Security: MPC reduces single-point-of-failure risks, but cloud shards rely on third-party security (Google, iCloud, AWS).

⸻

4️⃣ Technical Limitations
	•	Transaction Simulation: Detects risks but cannot guarantee 100% accuracy. Phishing or exploits may bypass checks.
	•	Migration Helper: Moving staked assets or complex DeFi positions is experimental. Always verify dry-run results before executing.

⸻

5️⃣ Open Source & Contributions
	•	Licensed under MIT. Contributions are welcome.
	•	Maintainers are not responsible for third-party code integrated into the project.

⸻

⚡ User Acknowledgement

By proceeding, you confirm that you are a technically sophisticated user who understands the inherent risks of:
	•	Blockchain technology
	•	Experimental smart contracts
	•	MPC & advanced cryptographic infrastructure
